# EV Market Segmentation Analysis â€“ India

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to segment the market into meaningful clusters based on demographic, economic, and industry-specific factors to assist an EV startup in making informed product and market-entry decisions.

---

## Problem Statement

As part of a strategic exploration, we aimed to identify distinct customer or market segments within the Indian EV landscape. The analysis uses real-world datasets to cluster regions or customer profiles based on features like age, income, market share, sales, and infrastructure availability. This segmentation helps businesses target the right audience and make data-driven decisions on pricing, marketing, and infrastructure planning.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze the EV market using demographic and business indicators.
- Perform KMeans clustering to discover unique market segments.
- Visualize clusters and interpret key differences among them.
- Help an EV startup decide its target customer base and deployment strategy.
