AGRICULTURAL MARKET SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS
FINAL INTERNSHIP TASK — MARKET ANALYSIS AND CLUSTERING ON AGRICULTURAL DATASET

Project Overview
This project involves analyzing agricultural market pricing data from various regions in India to identify meaningful market segments. Using data science techniques like exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and K-Means clustering, the project aims to support strategic decision-making for pricing, commodity focus, and geographic market targeting.

Objectives
Perform geographic and pricing segmentation on agricultural markets.
Identify high-value, stable, and volatile markets for strategic business insights.
Apply clustering techniques to segment markets based on pricing patterns and regional factors.
Dataset Information
Columns: State, District, Market, Commodity, Variety, Date, Min_Price, Max_Price, Modal_Price
Records: 2,238 rows (after cleaning)
Source: Provided as agricultural_dataset.csv (CSV file)

Key Analysis Steps
1.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
•	Removed malformed rows and rows with invalid prices.
•	Converted columns to appropriate data types.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	State, district, and market-wise distribution of records.
•	Pricing statistics including modal price, price range, and price volatility.
•	Visualization of key market characteristics.
3.	Segmentation Approach
•	Geographic Segmentation: Based on state and district activity levels.
•	Pricing Segmentation: Divided into Budget, Economy, Premium, and Luxury segments using quartiles.
4.	K-Means Clustering for Market Segmentation
•	Standardized feature set: Modal Price, Price Range, Price Volatility, and encoded geographic/commodity data.
•	Optimal cluster determination using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
•	Visualization of cluster profiles and detailed cluster-wise analysis.
5.	Strategic Insights & Recommendations
•	Identification of high-value markets, stable markets, and target commodities.
•	Cluster-based market strategy formulation for pricing and product placement.

Technologies & Libraries Used
•	Python
•	Pandas, NumPy
•	Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Scikit-learn

Output Highlights
1.	State and District Market Activity Charts
2.	Price Segment Distribution Pie Charts
3.	Cluster Profiles with Pricing and Volatility Patterns
4.	Market Entry Strategy Recommendations including:
•	High-value state targets
•	Stable market opportunities
•	Top-performing commodities

Applications
•	Helps agri-business firms, wholesalers, and policy makers in formulating data-driven marketing and pricing strategies.
•	Supports market entry planning for agricultural product companies.
•	A base for further predictive modeling in agri-market forecasting.
