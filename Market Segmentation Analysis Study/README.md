# Market Segmentation Analysis and R-to-Python Conversion – McDonald's Case Study

## Overview

This repository contains two key components:

1. **R to Python Code Conversion** – A practical translation of existing R-based data analysis code into Python, using libraries such as `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`. The original R code was part of the McDonald's market segmentation case study.

2. **Market Segmentation Analysis Study Report** – An analytical report that examines customer and business data to identify meaningful clusters. This study helps in understanding the market landscape and supports strategic decision-making.

## Contents

- `R_to_Python_Conversion.ipynb`  
  A Jupyter Notebook showcasing the step-by-step conversion from R to Python, maintaining functional equivalence with visual and statistical outputs.

- `Market_Segmentation_Study_Report.pdf`  
  A structured report covering:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Exploratory data analysis
  - Clustering (KMeans and Elbow Method)
  - Visualization of cluster-specific insights
  - Business implications
